                <p class="about">My parents always instilled in my siblings and me the importance of counting our blessings. They stressed that we should be thankful in all things, whether we are on the peak of the mountain or in the deepest valley, as just being called a child of God is the greatest blessing we could ask for. </p>
                <p class="about">Every November growing up, my mom would make a paper tree and hang it on the wall. Each day, every member of our family would write what we were thankful for on a leaf and tape it onto the tree. It could be anything: health, home, relationships, school, etc. She even made each and every visitor to our house do a leaf! This website is a way for our family to continue that tradition even as we live in various places, and to continue working on developing our <span class="font-italic font-underline"><u>Discipline of Gratitude.</u></span></p>
